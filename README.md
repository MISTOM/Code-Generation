# Code Generator

This project is a simple code generator that generates a specified number of random codes, each of a specified length. The codes are then saved to a CSV file.

## Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MISTOM/Code-Generation.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd Code_Generator
```

## Usage

To run the code generator:

```bash
node index.js
```

By default, this will generate 1,000,000 codes, each of length 5, and save them to a file named **codes.csv**.

To change the number of codes, the length of the codes, or the output file, you will need to modify the index.js file.
